This guide provides an overview for working with the :mod:`OptiDamTool` package.


Verify Installation
---------------------

To verify the installation, import the module and initialize the :class:`OptiDamTool.Network` class using the following code.
If no errors are raised, the installation is successful.


.. code-block:: python

    import OptiDamTool
    network = OptiDamTool.Network()
    
    
Adjacent Connectivity Between Dams 
---------------------------------------

To determine the adjacent upstream and downstream connectivity between dams based on a stream network, a stream shapefile is required.
This shapefile must contain a column representing a unique identifier for each stream segment.

Only one dam can be deployed per stream segment, and the dam is identified by the corresponding stream segmentâ€™s unique identifier.
The specified stream segment identifiers are used to designate dam deployment locations.

A sample stream shapefile is available in the  `data <https://github.com/debpal/OptiDamTool/tree/main/tests/data>`_ directory.
The following code generates dictionaries representing the adjacent upstream and downstream connectivity of dams based on the stream network.
Refer to the :meth:`OptiDamTool.Network.connectivity_adjacent` method for more details on the output.


.. code-block:: python

    # adjacent connectivity
    network.connectivity_adjacent(
        stream_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream.shp",
        stream_column='flw_id',
        dam_list=[21, 22, 5, 31, 17, 24, 27, 2, 13, 1]
    )
